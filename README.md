# FEMI---Fuzzy-EM-imputation
Missing value imputation using a fuzzy clustering-based EM approach

I had written this code few months back for college project.
It creats new complete xlsx file of Incomplete dataset by doing missing data imputation with Fuzzy Expectation Maximization Imputation (FEMI) method.
Reference
Logic used for this method is adapted from research paper published by Md. Geaur Rahaman and Md Zahidul Islam namely "Missing value imputation using a fuzzy clustering-based
EM approach" DOI 10.1007/s10115-015-0822-y
